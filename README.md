# Cool-Contacts
I and others wanted visually appealing icons for contacts.  This allows the user to construct a simplistic yet elegant contact photo by only giving 2 letter initials. The user can also choose a desired color of click through random but appealing colors. Application allows the user to preview and download the contact photos.
